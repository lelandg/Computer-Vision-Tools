Written as a practical exercise in WPF/XAML and to help me learn the computer 
vision algorithms as presented by Sebastian Thrun in the Stanford AI class.
(http://www.ai-class.com)

The results are always returned in mm. Thus, the measurement items are only 
for input. (I.e., if you change the dropdown from mm to cm, the value does not
change. That's an enhancement I'm working on.)

I know there are some empty files in here. I decided to save at a working 
point as a backup.

I also know there are ways to do this better, and I do plan to refactor and 
enhance this. You're welcome to enhance it for other purposes, and I'd like 
to see what you do.

Meanwhile, I'm also continuing to study AI.

Thanks for your interest,
