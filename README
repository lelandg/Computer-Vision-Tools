Written as a practical exercise in WPF/XAML and to help me learn the computer 
vision algorithms as presented by Sebastian Thrun in the Stanford AI class.

I know there are ways to do this better, and I do plan to refactor and enhance
this. You're welcome to enhance it for other purposes, and I'd like to see what
you do.

Meanwhile, I'm also continuing to study AI.

Thanks for your interest,
